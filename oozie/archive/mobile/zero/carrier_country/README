mobile/zero/carrier_country

The carrier_country/coordinator.xml file has been abstracted in a
way that allows it to operate generically with any Wikipedia Zero related metric,
so long as it operates as a single pig script which takes and input and an output
argument.  The carrier vs. country coordinator.properties files only differ in the
pig script and output path that they use, and so are able to use the exact same
coordinator.xml and workflow.xml files.

For organizational sanity, I've moved the differnent .properties into a subdirectory
called 'properties/'.  If you need to add new Zero oozie coordinators that can use
the same job xml definitions, feel free to add them there.

I have also separated out the main process action of the workflow into its own
process-wf.xml file.  The main workflow.xml file uses process-wf.xml and
coalesce-wf.xml as a sub-workflow actions.  The process-wf.xml configs could be
in the main workflow.xml file as a normal action type, but separating it out
into its own file allows us to run backfill coordinators without having
to coalesce the output after every backfill workflow process.  This speeds up
the backfilling process.  See the backfill coordinator .properties files for an
example where workflowPath=process-wf.xml.

I believe that I could abstract this subworkflow +  Oozie Pig input/output pattern into a single
reusable definition, decoupled from any particular metric at all.  One thing
at a time though... :)
